Service Function Chaining Driver for OpenDaylight
=================================================

This spec describes the plan to implement OpenStack networking-sfc[1] driver
for OpenDaylight Controller.

Problem Statement
===================
OpenStack SFC project (networking-sfc [1]) exposes generic APIs[2] for Service
Function Chaining (SFC) that can be implemented by any backend networking
service provider to support SFC. These APIs provide a way to integrate
OpenStack SFC with any of the backend SFC providers. OpenDaylight SFC project
provides a very mature implementation of SFC [3], but currently there is no
formal integration mechanism present to consume OpenDaylight as an SFC provider
for networking-sfc.

Recently Tacker project [4] has been approved as an official project in
OpenStack, that opens many possibilities to realize the NFV use cases (e.g SFC)
using OpenStack as a platform. Providing a formal end to end integration
between OpenStack and OpenDaylight for SFC use case will help NFV users
leverage OpenStack, Tacker and OpenDaylight as a solution. A POC for this
integration work has already been implemented [5][6] by Tim Rozet, but in
this POC work, Tacker directly communicates to OpenDaylight SFC & classifier
providers and not through OpenStack SFC APIs (networking-sfc).

Proposed Change
===============
Implementation of this spec will introduce a networking-sfc[1] driver for
OpenDaylight Controller in networking-odl project that will pass through
the networking-sfc API's call to the OpenDaylight Controller.

Detailed Design
===============
To enable the formal end to end integration between OpenStack SFC and
OpenDaylight requires an SFC driver for OpenDaylight. ODL SFC driver will
act as a shim layer between OpenStack and OpenDaylight that will carry out
following two main tasks:

* Translation of OpenStack SFC Classifier API to ODL SFC classifier yang
  models**.

* Translation of OpenStack SFC API's to OpenDaylight Neutron Northbound
  SFC models** [8].

** This work is not yet done, but the OpenDaylight neutron northbound project
needs to come up with yang models for SFC classification/chain. These models
will be based on the existing networking-sfc APIs. This work is out of scope
of networking-odl work and will be collaborated in the scope of OpenDaylight
Neutron Northbound project.

SFC providers (E.g Net-Virt, GBP, SFC ) in OpenDaylight can listen to these
OpenDaylight Neutron Northbound SFC models and translate it to their specific
yang models for classification/sfc. The following diagram shows the high level
integration between OpenStack and the OpenDaylight SFC provider::

In the above architecture, the opendaylight components are shown just to
understand the overall architecture, but it's out of scope of this spec's
work items. This spec will only track progress related to networking-odl
OpenStack sfc driver work.

Given that OpenStack SFC APIs are port-pair based API's and OpenDaylight SFC
API's are based on IETF SFC yang models[8], there might be situations where
translation might requires API enhancement from OpenStack SFC. Networking SFC
team is open for these new enhancement requirements given that they are generic
enough to be leveraged by other backend SFC providers[9]. This work will be
leveraging the POC work done by Tim [10] to come up with the first version of
SFC driver.

Dependencies
============
It has a dependency on OpenDaylight Neutron Northbound SFC classifier and chain
yang models, but that is out of scope of this spec.
