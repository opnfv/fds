Scenario: "OpenStack - OpenDaylight - FD.io DVR"
======================================================

Scenario: apex-os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha

"apex-os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha" is a scenario developed as part of the
FastDataStacks OPNFV project. The main components of the
"apex-os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha" scenario are:

 - APEX (TripleO) installer (please also see APEX installer documentation)
 - Openstack (in non-HA configuration)
 - OpenDaylight controller (non-clustered) controlling networking
 - FD.io/VPP virtual forwarder for tenant and public networking; the virtual
   forwarder serves as layer 3 forwarder on each compute node, providing high
   availability of layer 3 services

Introduction
============

NFV and virtualized high performance applications, such as video processing,
require a "fast data stack" solution that provides both carrier grade
forwarding performance, scalability and open extensibility, along with
functionality for realizing application policies and controlling a complex
network topology.

A solution stack is only as good as its foundation. Key foundational assets for
NFV infrastructure are

  * The virtual forwarder: The virtual forwarder needs to be a feature rich,
    high performance, highly scale virtual switch-router. It needs to leverage
    hardware accelerators when available and run in user space.
    In addition, it should be modular and easily extensible.
  * Forwarder diversity: A solution stack should support a variety of
    forwarders, hardware forwarders (physical switches and routers)
    as well as software forwarders. This way virtual and physical
    forwarding domains can be seamlessly glued together.
  * Policy driven connectivity: Connectivity should respect and
    reflect different business policies

In order to meet the desired qualities of an NFV infrastructure, the
following components were chosen for the "Openstack - OpenDaylight - FD.io"
scenario:

  * FD.io Vector Packet Processor (VPP) - a highly scalable, high performance,
    extensible virtual forwarder providing fully distributed routing on each
    compute node
  * OpenDaylight Controller - an extensible controller platform which
    offers the ability to separate business logic from networking
    constructs, supports a diverse set of network devices
    (virtual and physical) via the "Group-Based Policy (GBP)"
    component, and can be clustered to achieve a highly available
    deployment.

The "Openstack - OpenDaylight - FD.io DVR" scenario provides the capability to
realize a set of use-cases relevant to the deployment of NFV nodes instantiated
by means of an Openstack orchestration system on FD.io/VPP enabled controller
and compute nodes, with computes nodes being the hosts for distributed virtual
routing. Distributed virtual routing enables all forwarding operations to be
available locally on each compute node, removing scaling issues and performance
bottlenecks. In addition, the forwarding setup is highly available since
a failure on a given compute node is local to that node and doesn't affect
routing anywhere else. The role of the Opendaylight network controller in this
integration is twofold. It provides a network device configuration and topology
abstraction via the Openstack Neutron interface, while providing the capability
to realize more complex network policies by means of Group Based Policies.
Furthermore it also provides the capabilities to monitor as well as visualize
the operation of the virtual network devices and their topologies.
In supporting the general use-case of instantiatiting an NFV instance,
VXLAN GPE overlay encapsulation transport network is used.

A deployment of the "apex-os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha" scenario consists of 4 or more
servers:

  * 1 Jumphost hosting the APEX installer - running the Undercloud
  * 1 Controlhost, which runs the Overcloud as well as
      OpenDaylight as a network controller
  * 2 or more Computehosts. These Computehosts also serve as layer 3 gateways
    for tenant networks and provide ditributed virtual routing

Tenant and public networking leverages FD.io/VPP. On compute nodes,
VPP binds to both the tenant networking interface as well as the public
networking interface. This means that VPP is used for communication within
a tenant network, between tenant networks, as well as between a tenant network
and the Internet.

Note that this setup differs from the usual centralized layer 3 setup with
qrouter on a controller node. There is no layer 2 networking. The OpenDaylight
network controller is used to setup and manage layer 3 networking for the
scenario, with Group Based Policy (GBP) and Locator/Identifier Separation
Protocol (LISP) Flow Mapping Service being the key components. Tenant
networking leverages VXLAN GPE encapsulation, where LISP Flow Mapping Service
and the LISP protocol in VPP create tunnels between nodes where it's required,
providing dynamic, fail-safe connectivity between nodes and obviating the need
for full mesh maintanance and monitoring.

The picture below shows an example setup with two compute and one controller
nodes. Note that the external network is connected via each compute node
through VPP, providing full distributed routing. VPP provides almost all
layer 3 services which are provided in a "vanilla" OpenStack deployment,
including one-to-one NAT but not source NAT, as well as north-south and
east-west traffic filtering for security purposes ("security groups").

Features of the scenario
========================

Main features of the "apex-os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha" scenario:

  * Automated installation using the APEX installer
  * Fast and scalable tenant networking using FD.io/VPP as forwarder
  * Layer 3 tenant networking using VXLAN GPE, managed
    and controlled through OpenDaylight and LISP protocol in FD.io/VPP
  * Layer 3 connectivitiy for tenant networks supplied
    through FD.io/VPP. Layer 3 features, including security groups as well as
    floating IP addresses (i.e. NAT) are implemented by the FD.io/VPP forwarder
  * Manual and automatic (via DHCP relaying) addressing on tenant networks

Scenario components and composition
===================================

The apex-os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha scenario combines components from three key open
source projects: OpenStack, OpenDaylight, and Fast Data (FD.io). The key
components that realize the apex-os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha scenario and which differ
from a regular OVS-based scenario are the OpenStack ML2 OpenDaylight plugin,
OpenDaylight Neutron Northbound, OpenDaylight Group Based Policy, OpenDaylight
Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol Flow Mapping Service,
FD.io Honeycomb management agent and FD.io Vector Packet Processor (VPP).

Here's a more detailed list of the individual software components involved:

**Openstack Neutron ML2 OpenDaylight Plugin**: Handles Neutron data base
synchronization and interaction with the southbound controller using a REST
interface.

**ODL GBP Neutron Mapper**: Maps neutron elements like networks, subnets,
security groups, etc. to GBP entities: Creates policy and configuration for
tenants (endpoints, resolved policies, forwarding rules).

**ODL GBP Neutron VPP Mapper**: Maps Neutron ports to VPP endpoints in GBP.

**ODL GBP Location Manager**: Provides real location for endpoints (i.e. Which
physical node an endpoint is connected to).

**GBP Renderer Manager**: Creates configuration for Renderers (like e.g.
VPP-Renderer or OVS-Renderer). The GBP Renderer Manager is the central point
for dispatching of data to specific device renderers.  It uses the information
derived from the GBP end-point and its topology entries to dispatch the task
of configuration to a specific device renderer by writing a renderer policy
configuration into the registered renderer's policy store. The renderer
manager also monitors, by being a data change listener on the VPP Renderer
Policy States, for any errors in the application of a rendered configuration.

**GBP VPP Renderer Interface Manager**: Listens to VPP endpoints in the
Config DataStore and configures associated interfaces on VPP via HoneyComb.

**LISP Flow Mapping Service**: Stores location information for tenant VMs,
where the location is the IP address of the compute host running the VM,
represented as a LISP Routing Locator (RLOC) and the tenant VM address is
represented as a LISP Endpoint Identifier (EID). The above information is
stored in an EID-to-RLOC database maintained by the Service, added by the LISP
VPP component through the LISP Plugin, and is made available for retrieval to
any compute node. Implements a pub/sub mechanism, where changes in a mapping
are notified to data forwarders which have previously asked for that
particular mapping.

**LISP Plugin**: Implements the LISP control protocol and is responsible for
receiving/sending UDP LISP control packets on the cloud (compute/controller)
network, translating them to/from YANG modeled data structures used in
OpenDaylight, and passing/getting those structures to/from the LISP Flow
Mapping Service.

**Virtual Packet Processor (VPP)**: The VPP is the
accelerated data plane forwarding engine relying on vhost user interfaces
towards Virtual Machines created by the Nova Agent.

**VPP LISP**: Creates traffic driven dynamic tunnels between compute nodes,
encapsulating tenant VM traffic with VXLAN GPE, using mapping information from
the LISP Flow Mapping Service. It is also registering mapping information about
VMs on its host compute (or controller) node to the same service.

**Honeycomb Netconf server**:
The Honeycomb NETCONF configuration server is responsible for driving
the configuration of the VPP, and collecting operational data.

**Nova Agent**: The Nova Agent, a sub-component of the overall Openstack
architecture, is responsible for interacting with the compute node's host
Libvirt API to drive the life-cycle of Virtual Machines. It, along with the
compute node software, are assumed to be capable of supporting vhost user
interfaces.

The picture below shows the key components.

Neutron Port Callflow
=====================

When a port is created or updated, Neutron sends data to ODL Neutron Northbound
which contain UUID, along with a host-id such as
"overcloud-novacompute-0.opnfv.org" and vif-type as "vhost-user".
The GBP Neutron mapper turns the "Neutron speak" of
"ports" into the generic connectivity model that GroupBasedPolicy uses.
Neutron "ports" become generic "GBP Endpoints" which can be consumed by the
GBP Renderer Manager. The GBP Renderer Manager resolves the policy for the
endpoint, i.e. it determines which communication relationships apply to the
specific endpoint, and hands the resolution to a device specific renderer,
which is the VPP renderer in the given case here. VPP renderer turns the
generic policy into VPP specific configuration. Note that in case the policy
would need to be applied to a different device, e.g. an OpenVSwitch (OVS),
then an "OVS Renderer" would be used.

VPP Renderer communicated with the device using Netconf/Yang.
All compute and controller nodes run an instance of
VPP and the VPP-configuration agent "Honeycomb". Honeycomb serves as a
Netconf/YANG server, receives the configuration commands from VBD and VPP
Renderer and drives VPP configuration using VPP's local Java APIs.

The network configuration rendered to VPP sets up Proxy-ARP, a destination to
be used for north-south packet flow, the address of OpenDaylight and for each
VM, a mapping from the tenant VM address to VPP's own addres (compute node),
used for east-west traffic. These mappings are periodically sent by VPP LISP
using the LISP protocol through the LISP Plugin to the LISP Flow Mapping
Service. Mappings are retrieved on-demand and cached by VPP LISP for VMs on
other compute nodes, when traffic exists.

To provide a better understanding how the above mentioned components interact
with each other, the following diagram shows how the example of creating a
vhost-user port on VPP through Openstack Neutron:

.. image:: FDS-simple-callflow.png

DHCP Packet Flow
================

DHCP traffic from a VM first arrives at vhost-user port in VPP, which is
configured as unnumbered with ip of loopback interface (which corresponds
with tenant interface port) for the VRF where the VM resides.
DHCP proxy is configured to relay DHCP packets to the DHCP server created by
neutron-dhcp-agent running on the node where the VM was created. DHCP relay
sets the destination ip to the ip of the DHCP server and source ip to the
loopback ip. Opendaylight configures a route for the DHCP server, sending
packets to the tap port which is connected to the DHCP namespace.

East-West Packet Flow
=====================

Suppose we have VM1 on compute1 sending traffic to VM2 on compute2. This
traffic will flow according to the rules in the forwarding information bases
(FIBs) in the VPP processes on the compute nodes. The L3 destination on the
packets is the tenant address of VM2, and VM1 does ARP resolution for the
subnet gateway address for the L2 destination. The Proxy-ARP service from VPP
on compute1 replies with the MAC address of itself, so it can intercept the
packet.

Once the packet reaches VPP, it is sent to the VPP LISP component for
processing (the default action when LISP is enabled), which performs a mapping
lookup using a Map-Request LISP control packet sent to ODL. At this point, the
packet is dropped, because no buffering is performed for data plane packets
without a FIB entry. The Map-Request packet is decoded by the LISP Plugin, and
the mapping request is passed on to the LISP FLow Mapping Service. Since VM2
was registering its mapping to ODL when it was created, the lookup is
successful and returns the address of compute2, where VM2 resides, in a
Map-Reply packet. VPP LISP installs a FIB entry specifying that packets with
destination VM2 are to be VXLAN GPE encapsulated towards compute2. Once this
FIB entry is installed, subsequent packets towards VM2 are automatically
encapsulated (no further lookups are necessary until the mapping is valid).

Once the first packet is actually encapsulated towards VM2 and VM2 generates a
reply, the same process is repeated for the reverse direction.

.. image:: FDS-east-west-traffic.png

North-South Packet Flow
=======================

Consider VM1 on compute1 from the section above sends a packet to an external
destination. VPP LISP does the mapping lookup with ODL in the same way, but it
receives a "negative" mapping, which doesn't specify an encapsulation
destinaiton address (RLOC). This means that packet needs to be forwarded
"natively".

As mentioned above VPP Renderer stores the "native-forward" destination with
VPP, which is then used for delivering the packet. When the packet reaches the
gateway, it is NATed to the outside world using simple one-to-one NAT, if VM1
has a floating IP configured.

Scenario Configuration and Deployment
=====================================

The Apex documentation contains information on how to properly setup your
enviroment and how to modify the configuration files.

To deploy the "apex-os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha" scenario, select the
os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha.yaml as your deploy settings and use the
network_settings_vpp.yaml file as template to create a network configuration
file. Both of these are in /etc/opnfv-apex.

The file os-odl-fdio-dvr-noha.yaml mentioned above contains this
configuration::

  deploy_options:
    sdn_controller: opendaylight
    odl_version: oxygen
    odl_routing_node: dvr
    tacker: true
    congress: true
    sfc: false
    vpn: false
    vpp: true
    dataplane: fdio
    performance:
      Controller:
        kernel:
          hugepages: 1024
          hugepagesz: 2M
          intel_iommu: 'on'
          iommu: pt
          isolcpus: 1,2
        vpp:
          main-core: 1
          corelist-workers: 2
          uio-driver: uio_pci_generic
      Compute:
        kernel:
          hugepagesz: 2M
          hugepages: 2048
          intel_iommu: 'on'
          iommu: pt
          isolcpus: 1,2
        vpp:
          main-core: 1
          corelist-workers: 2
          uio-driver: uio_pci_generic

The earliest usable ODL version is Oxygen. "odl_routing_node" with value dvr
chooses the dvr setup and vpp: true and dataplane:fdio together enable vpp
instead of ovs. The perfomance options are vpp specific. The default hugepages
configuration leaves only 3.5GB for VMs (2M * 2048 - 512 for VPP), so if you
wish to have more memory for VMs, either increase the number of hugepages
(hugepages) or the size of each hugepage (hugepagesz) for computes.

In order to create a VM in Openstack you need to use a flavor which uses
hugepages. One way to configure such flavor is this::

  openstack flavor create nfv --property hw:mem_page_size=large

Limitations, Issues and Workarounds
===================================

Source NAT is not supported, meaning a VM without floating ip will not be able
to reach networks outside of Opnestack Cloud (e.g. the Internet). Only
one-to-one NAT is supported (i.e. floating ips).

For other information on limitations and issues, please refer to the APEX
installer release notes.
